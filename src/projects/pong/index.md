This was a sample game created for a high-school web development class
(shout-out to [CodeNation]!) The class goal was to add multi-player games to a
game-hub using React and Firebase. The game hub set up most of the
infrastructure around handling users and sessions. The repo with the students'
games is here: <https://github.com/jtessler/studio-multiplayer-game>.

Originally this was multi-player Pong
([see here](https://github.com/jtessler/studio-multiplayer-game/blob/master/src/games/pong/Pong.js)),
but I pulled out the Firebase components and made it a single-player standalone
game because I liked it.
